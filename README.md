Module No.1: Swapping and Shifting.
 - Here we have the option to switch or swap objects on the screen.
 - One button creates the objects, they appear on the screen one after the other.
 - Then the two buttons - Swap and Shift.
 - The buttons have two modes - Active (Green) and Passive (Red). By Default both Buttons are Passive.
 - The Idea was that on cliking the buttons - Shift or Swap, they would switch to Active Mode.
 - Only 1 button of the two can the Active at the same time. If we try to turn the other mode Active when another Mode is also Active, the pervios mode automatically turns Passive.
 - Swapping, exchanges the location of both items.
 - Shifting, moves all the elements in between the selected positions toward the blank space. Here is an Example (Below)

                   Seq : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

        Lets say we want to Shift 6 to 2's Place

               New Seq : 1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
